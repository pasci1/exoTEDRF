Contributing to exoTEDRF
==========

Whether you just want a bug fixed or want to design a whole new feature, here you'll find some useful information if you'd like to contribute to **exoTEDRF**.

If you find a bug in the code, or have a request for a feature which is not yet implemented, please feel free to raise an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/radicamc/exoTEDRF/issues>`_.

When you install **exoTEDRF**, whether through GitHub or pip, you'll have all the content on the :code:`main` branch -- the current official code release.
Like many open source projects, all new feature developments, bug fixes, etc. happen on the :code:`dev` branch, and are rigorously tested before being merged into the :code:`main` code.
If you'd like to create a new feature in **exoTEDRF**, you can either fork the repository, or create a new branch off of :code:`dev`, where you can work on your improvements without worrying about breaking anything in the main code release!

The one main exception to this workflow is for major bug fixes, which will be implemented directly in :code:`main`. However, I hope these will be few and far between!

Thanks in advance for your contributions, regardless of how small they might be!
